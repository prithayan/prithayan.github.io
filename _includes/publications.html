We present a language and compilation framework for productively generating high-performance systolic arrays for dense tensor kernels on spatial architectures, including FPGAs and CGRAs. It decouples a functional specification from a spatial mapping, allowing programmers to quickly explore various spatial optimizations for the same function. The actual implementation of these optimizations is left to a compiler. Thus, productivity and performance are achieved at the same time. We used this framework to implement several important dense tensor kernels. We implemented dense matrix multiply for an Arria-10 FPGA and a research CGRA, achieving 88% and 92% of the performance of manually written, and highly optimized expert (ninja") implementations in just 3% of their engineering time. Three other tensor kernels, including MTTKRP, TTM and TTMc, were also implemented with high performance and low design effort, and for the first time on spatial architectures."

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In this paper, we propose a cryptosystem which can encrypt and decrypt long (text) messages in efficient manner. The proposed cryptosystem is a combination of symmetric-key and asymmetric-key cryptography, where asymmetric-key cryptography is used to transmit the secret key to an intended receiver and the sender/receiver encrypts/decrypts messages using that secret key. In 2002, Hwang et al. proposed a scheme for encrypting long messages. The main drawback of their scheme is that it requires more computational overhead. Our proposed scheme is more efficient from the computational point of view compared to that of their scheme. Our scheme is a block cipher, long messages are broken into fixed length plaintext blocks for encryption. It supports parallel computation, since encryption/decryption of all the blocks of plaintext/plaintext are independent and thus can be carried out simultaneously. In addition, our scheme retains the same security level as their scheme.
